# This repository contains RL learning examples

using Unity and https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.

In the following sections, I will describe the environments, their state and action spaces and the reward settings.

# balance_broom
The agent controls a plane, on which an inverted broom stands. The agent moves the plane so that the broom doesn't fall (more precisely, so that its inclining angle is less than 30 degrees.

* state size : 8
  1. The position of the broom with respect to the center of the plane (2 float numbers)
  2. The velocity of the broom (2 float numbers)
 Â 3. The angle between the broom and the normal vector of the plane, the y axis (2 float numbers)
  4. The angular velocity of the broom (2 float numbers)
